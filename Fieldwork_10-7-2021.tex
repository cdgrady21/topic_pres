\protect\hypertarget{what-is-a-field-experiment}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An experiment done outside of a lab, with real people who don't know
  they are part of an experiment

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lab: show people video, survey those people
  \item
    Field: Show a video in a local theatre; survey people who attended
  \end{itemize}

How to get involved with implementers

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Professor throws you a project
\item
  Meet at a conference
\item
  Pro bono ``cold call'' from you
\item
  University collaborations
\item
  Sites that connect researchers and implementers: research4impact,
  egap, others
\item
  Implementers want prior RCT experience, experience in-country
\item
  Bigger NGOs will want established professors

How to work with non-academics

Priorities and incentives

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Implementing organizations will want you to do a lot of work that is
  irrelevant for you
\item
  Look our for your own interests
\item
  Implementers \emph{need} to make themselves look good to maintain
  grant funding

\begin{frame}{Being in the Field}
\protect\hypertarget{being-in-the-field}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You need to go
\item
  You want to go
\item
  Establish personal relationships or you will be in the dark and
  nothing will get done
\item
  Bring gifts that are identifiably \emph{American}
\end{itemize}

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Implementer priority: show their project is successful, not to
  evaluate if the project was successful.
\end{itemize}

\note{

You need to be involved with the intervention, not lead it from afar.

Otherwise you'll find out 6 months later that they did not like the randomization and so didn't use it.  Or that they started the intervention before the baseline survey because they didn't want to wait.  Or that a control site and treatment site are less than 1 mile apart.  Or that they changed the intervention and it's totally different now (NGOs are _always_ adapting).

  Randomization at multiple levels

    wording changes every interview

- Questions in one context make no sense in another context
- Yes/No + how strongly do you feel > likert scales.
- Huge agreement bias.


Would you be comfortable with someone from the same religion but a different denomination marrying into your family?
Would you be comfortable with someone from a different religion marrying into your family?

Would you accept someone from a different religion seeking your hand in marriage without converting? - 85% no
Would you accept someone from a different religion seeking marriage with one of your family members without converting? - 85% no

Would you marry someone you loved, even if they practiced a different religion? - 50% yes, 50% no.


There is more than one valid interpretation of religious teachings.

An Arabic word Bid'ah means innovation, connotation heretical teachings.  Innovations -- unorthodox interpretations of Koranic teachings -- are often blamed for violence in NE Nigeria.  So lots of tolerant people said no.
